            <p>Above is a photo of my class schedule for this semester. My
                hardest class is definitely EECS 281 and my favorite class is SI
                339. With such a crazy schedule it is very important to keep a
                calender or planner to keep track of everything. I like to keep
                a calender with my schedule with my class on my computer so I
                can also view it on my phone. I write down everything I have to
                do in a planner and check things off throughout the day. I love
                my planner becuase if I don't write down all my assignments I
                sometimes forget to do something. I recommend making a new page
                in your planner for each day to keep things organized.</p>
