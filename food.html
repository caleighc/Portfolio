            <p>As a college student I do not have a lot of money to spend on
                food so I
                have to cook most of my meals. I get my groceeries from Trader
                Joe's or
                <a href="https://www.imperfectfoods.com">Imperfect foods</a>.
                Over the past
                few years I have perfected my grocery list.

            <h3>Cooking</h3>

            <p>I love to cook and try out new recepies! Some of my favorite
                things I have
                cooked are pictured below. I made fried rice with day old white
                rice, minced garlic,
                edemame, corn, carrots, and butter (on the left). I also made
                balsamic Brussel
                sprouts, sweat potatoes, and chicken (in the middle) as another
                meal. Last, (on the right)
                my roommates and I made a huge breakfast spread before a
                football game!</p>

            <h4>Eating Out</h4><br>

            <p>I love exploring new resteruant in Ann Arbor on the weekends, but
                I definitely have my favorites! My go to late night snack is a
                slice of Joe's pizza (on the left). I always get the caprese
                slice and the fresh mozarella slice. When I'm
                feeling like eating healthy I run to
                revive for a delicious salad (in the middle). My most favorite
                lunch spot is Poke Fish. I always get
                the same thing: a tuna poke bowl with tons of toppings (on the
                right). </p>
