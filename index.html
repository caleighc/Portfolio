            <!-- Paragraph about myself that needs to be edited -->

            <p>I am a student at the
                <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>
                studying computer science. I am applying to the School of
                Information
                where I want to pursue a UX Design major.
                I am origionally from Los Angeles, California. At home I live 5
                minutes from
                the beach so I love to surf and swim on the weekends. Coming
                from California all
                the way to Michigan has been a big adjustment for me so I am
                going to share
                some of my college tips!</p>

            <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="A photo of me and my friends.">
            <p>Above is a photo I took right after I got accepted to the
                University of Michigan!</p>

            <p>It is very important to have a balanced lifestyle in college.
                School can be very challenging so it is very important to have
                outlets to release stress. I rely a lot on my friends to keep me
                sane but I also meditate to destress. It is very important to
                have consistent meal plan. Last, it is crutial to have well
                thought out schedule to get all your schoolwork done.</p>
